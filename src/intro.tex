\emph{Verified topological data analysis} refers to the topological analysis of data along with a \emph{verifiable guarantee} that the observed structure accurately reflects the topology of the underlying space, or function.
In particular, this work focuses on two methods for verifying the \emph{persistent homology} of sampled data: confirming the computed diagram is sufficiently interleaved with that of the underlying space by confirming \emph{coverage}, and computing a so-called \emph{sub-barcode} from the sample that is guaranteed to reflect only topological features of the underlying function free of noise.
The former provides a bound on the bottleneck distance between the computed diagram and that of the target function by making assumptions on the underlying domain.
The latter makes no such assumptions, and applies to situations in which coverage cannot be confirmed, provided a limited diagram that can be used for falsification.
